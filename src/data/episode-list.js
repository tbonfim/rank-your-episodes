To return the Princess, the kidnapper demands that the country's Prime Minister, Michael Callow, has sexual intercourse with a pig on live television, otherwise he will kill her. Callow refuses to be blackmailed, but public opinion is gradually turning against him. Security forces are trying to locate the kidnapper, but every effort fails. Under pressure, Callow finally agrees to fulfill the demand. The British people gather in public places and watch the shocking broadcast, with no one realising that the kidnapper has already released the Princess, thirty minutes before Callow's sex act began. The kidnapper commits suicide by hanging and he is later revealed to be an artist, who planned the debacle in order to make a statement on people's obsession with the media. One year later, Callow's approval ratings have fully recovered, but his relationship with his wife has suffered a heavy blow.",

One day, he hears a girl named Abi singing in the bathroom and falls in love with her. He decides to gift her fifteen million merits, that she can use to buy a ticket for a talent show. Abi accepts and enters the contest, where she is given a psychotropic beverage to drink before she goes on stage. The judges are impressed with her singing, but they suggest she is better suited for pornography. Abi accepts their offer, unable to think clearly. Bing returns to the stationary bikes, determined to earn back the merits he needs to enter the contest himself, and finally manages to buy a new ticket. When he enters the stage, he takes the opportunity to express his indignation and threatens to commit suicide, while other members are watching in the audience. When he finishes talking, the judges offer him a weekly show, where he will have the opportunity to rant about the system. Bing accepts their offer.",

At a dinner party, Liam is suspicious of his wife Ffion's behaviour towards a man named Jonas. Returning home, Ffion admits that she used to be in a relationship with him. The next morning, Liam drunkenly heads to Jonas' house and forces him to delete every memory of sexual intercourse he had with Ffion. In the memories appearing on the monitor, Liam notices one from the time when he and Ffion were already in a relationship. Liam, afraid that he might not be the biological father of his child, returns home and demands that Ffion show him the re-do of that specific sexual encounter, in order to prove that they had used a condom. The re-do verifies that the two of them had unprotected sex. Sometime later, having been left alone in his house, Liam goes to the bathroom and uses a razor blade to cut out the grain from behind his ear.",

This service helps her overcome her despair, until one day she accidentally drops her phone and panics. The artificial Ash tells her of the service's experimental stage, in which she agrees to have the replica transferred into a synthetic body, almost identical to Ash. However, Martha realises that the android is not able to replicate the small details in her loved one's behaviour and starts distancing herself from it. Finally, Martha takes the artificial Ash to a cliff and orders it to jump off. As it begins to follow the order, Martha expresses her frustration that Ash would not have simply obeyed. As a response, the android starts begging for its life. Unable to get rid of it, she ends up keeping the android in the attic, where a few years later her little daughter visits it every weekend.",

Matt used to help single men seduce women. His clients had optical implants that allowed him to see through their eyes and give them advice in real-time using the \"Eye-Link\" technology. His main profession, however, was subjugating artificial copies of clients' consciousness, stored into bean-sized chips called \"cookies\", into docile personal assistants in charge of running smart houses. Joe reveals that after a domestic squabble, his pregnant girlfriend Beth \"blocked\" him, using a technology that turned them into incomprehensible pixelated blurs to each other. The block lasted for years, preventing him from talking to Beth or the child, until Beth died in an accident. Joe found the child in Beth's father's cabin, but the man told him that the little girl was not his daughter. Angered, Joe bashed his head with an object and left. After Joe tells Matt that the girl also died in the blizzard, trying to get help for her grandfather, it is revealed that everything is taking place inside Joe's cookie, where Matt was trying to extract Joe's confession, in exchange for his own release from prison. Due to his Eye-Link-related voyeurism, Matt is registered as a sex offender, resulting in him being universally blocked following his release. Joe's artificial consciousness remains trapped in the cabin, having its time perception changed to 1,000 years a minute.",

After a series of mishaps on her way to the wedding that send her ratings plummeting, Naomi calls Lacie and tells her not to come. Enraged, Lacie manages to get to the celebratory dinner; she grabs the microphone and starts giving the speech she had written. The guests rate her negatively, causing her rating to drop to zero. She becomes dangerously upset and security removes her from the area. She is placed in a cell and has the technology supporting the rating system removed from her eyes.

A gadget with the ability to layer lifelike images and sounds into his perception is implanted at the back of his neck, though a phone call from his mother causes an interference during the initialisation process. After the gadget probes his brain for information on things that scare him, the test begins with Cooper being left alone in a spooky mansion. There, Cooper endures some jumpscares at first, but when he later experiences severe mental and physical pain the test is terminated. Cooper returns home to his mother, who does not recognise him, and he realises that—like his father—she too has been afflicted with Alzheimer's. At this point, it is revealed that all events subsequent to the signal interference were taking place in Cooper's head.

        "description": "Frank and Amy are two of several that participate in the System, where they are instructed by a personal device called the Coach to meet other people and spend a pre-determined amount of time with them. Frank and Amy are matched for a short period but both find themselves attracted to each other. After several more assignments, the two are rematched by Coach, but Amy insists they not look at the time prescribed by Coach. They spend much time together, but Frank is drawn to look at the time given by Coach, and finds that initially lasting several years, his action caused the time to reduce considerably. They are both soon rematched, with Amy assigned to a new partner that will be her permanent pair. Amy asks Coach for her to see Frank one last time, during which she encourages to break the System, fleeing the area and climbing over an impossibly high wall. At the top, they discover they are one pair of nearly one thousand Franks and Amys that have escaped the system. This is all revealed to be the inner workings of a dating app being used by the real-life Frank and Amy, testing their compatibility by simulating their behavior over one thousand trials.",

While trying to retrieve supplies from a warehouse, Bella's companions are killed by the robots, but she manages to flee and evade their tracking devices. After eluding a sole robot by exhausting it of its power, Bella makes her way to a secured home, finding a shotgun and other weapons. However, the robot, after recharging, finds her trail. Bella manages to blind the robot and then destroy it with the shotgun, but not before the robot fires off more tracking devices, several of which embed themselves in her skin. Bella considers pulling them out but recognizes it is futile as she would sever her carotid artery in the process. As more robots swarm towards the house, she radios her base to let them know what happened. It is revealed Bella's team was trying to recover teddy bears for the survivors.",

        "description": "Nish stops to recharge her car and enters the nearby \"Black Museum\", owned and run by Rolo Haynes. Rolo shows her various artifacts, all related to illicit technology that he had been involved with. He describes several stories connected to them. One involves Dr. Peter Dawson, a doctor who developed a device that allowed him to experience the pain of his patients to aid in diagnosis, but soon found pain giving way to addictive pleasure, and eventually killed a man to experience the sensation. Another case involves Carrie, a comatose woman whose consciousness was transferred into her husband Jack, but when Jack started seeing another woman, he forcefully transferred Carrie into a plush monkey for their son Parker who soon discarded the toy as he grew up; Carrie still is alive within the plush at the museum. Rolo shows Nish the star attraction of the museum, a holographic representation of the consciousness of convicted murderer Clayton Leigh that Rolo bought just prior to his electrocution, allowing visitors to electrocute him repeatedly. Nish reveals that her visit was not incidental, as she is the daughter of Clayton, who was wrongfully convicted. After poisoning Rolo, Nish transfers Rolo's consciousness into Clayton's head, much like Carrie was transferred into Jack's head, forcing him to live through the last electrocution which overloads Clayton's synapses and wipes the digital copies of them both. Rolo's agony is captured in a souvenir keychain which Nish takes along with the doll with Carrie's consciousness and shorts out the museum's electricity, starting a fire. Nish drives off with her mother, her consciousness living within Nish, tells her Clayton would be proud of her.",

He pitches the game to Mohan Thakur, who works for video game company Tuckersoft, while Stefan works on the game at home on his own. Stefan begins to feel like he is being controlled and descends into madness in the same way that the book author Jerome F. Davies did. The viewer chooses his actions, which can lead him variously to discuss his mother's death with his therapist, take hallucinogens with game creator Colin Ritman, kill his father Peter, kill Thakur and experience vivid dreams, among other things.",
